# Youtube Music Party

Listen to music with your friends on Youtube Music.

## Why?

I like listening music.
I wanted to listen music with my friends but YouTube Music doesn't have feature so.
Then I wanted to make this extension.
It's a simple extension which listen play, pause, seek and Media
change events and post to other members via websocket.
